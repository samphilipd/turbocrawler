Intro
=====

Write a simple web crawler in a programming language of your choice. Feel free to either choose one you're very familiar with or, if you'd like to learn some Go, you can also make this your first Go program!

Spec
====

- Crawler is limited to one domain. E.g. when crawling tomblomfield.com it crawls all pages within the domain, but not external links, for example to the Facebook and Twitter accounts.
- Given a URL, it outputs a site map, showing which static assets each page depends on, and the links between pages.
- Write it as you would a production piece of code.
- Bonus points for tests and making it as fast as possible!

Site map data structure
=======================

[
  {
    path => '/example',
    static_assets => [
      '/example.png'.
      '/example.js'
    ],
    internal_links => [
      '/example/1'.
      '/example/2'
    ]
  },
  { ... },
  ...
]
